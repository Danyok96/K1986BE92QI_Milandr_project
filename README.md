# K1986BE92QI_Milandr_project

Tasks:

1. Write a function that adjusts the frequency of the microcontroller from an external 8 MHz quartz (HSE signal source) to a given frequency. The desired frequency value is passed as a function parameter.
2. Write a function that configures the timer interrupt with a given frequency, depending on the configured frequency of the microcontroller. Provide an indication of the operation of the interrupt by means of LEDs.
3. Write a function that configures the universal transceiver uart for the specified speed of information transmission, depending on the configured frequency of the microcontroller. Ensure that the data on the frequency of the microcontroller is transmitted to the PC via the interrupt from point 2.
4. Write a function that provides information output to the display: full name, group, microcontroller frequency, interrupt frequency, UART speed, and the number of interrupts made.

All items must be completed within a single project.
